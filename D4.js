/*

    Module 8 - D4

    Start from the previous portfolio React project.

    The goal is to rewrite the application using REDUX with multiple reducers and thunk middleware

    Features:

    - Re-organize your application in order to implement the redux pattern with multiple reducers and thunk middleware
    - Implement "Loading" and "Error" states in the Redux Store, "Loading" should trigger a spinner (save them in a status section)
    - Students, Projects, Review should now be stored in the Redux Store (save them in a data section, use async action creators)

    Important: Usually redux is used in more complex projects. In this case it's a overshooting but you need to learn redux
    since it's an ace in your sleeve to skyrocket your career.
