/*

    Module 8 - D3

    Start from the previous portfolio React project.

    The goal is to rewrite the application using REDUX

    Features:

    - Re-organize your application in order to implement the redux pattern
    - Implement "Loading" and "Error" states in the Redux Store, "Loading" should trigger a spinner
    - Don't save Students, Projects and Review in the Redux Store for now (they require an async middleware)

    Important: Usually redux is used in more complex projects. In this case it's a overshooting but you need to learn redux
    since it's an ace in your sleeve to skyrocket your career.
